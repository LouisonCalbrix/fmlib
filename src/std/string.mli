(** [compare s1 s2] Compare the strings [s1] and [s2].

(** [list str] Convert the string [str] to a list of characters. *)

val concat: string -> string list -> string
(** [concat sep str_list] Concatenate the strings in the string list [str_list]

(** [split_on_char c str] Split the string [str] on each occurrence of the

        The function works internally with a buffer. [n] is used to guide the
        buffer allocation and the resizing of the buffer. The better the
