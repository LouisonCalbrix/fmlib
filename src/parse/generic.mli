        Elementary parsing step.

        The function [f] is called with two arguments:
        - The current state
        - The next lookahead token (or none, if the end of the token stream has
        been reached).

        [f] must return either an object of type ['a] and a new state if it
        accepts the token, or a failed expectation if it rejects the token.

        - [state] Initial state
        - [p] Combinator which returns in case of success an object of type
        [Final.t]
        - [e] Error function. Generates an expectation from the state. The
        function is used if at the expected end of input other token arrive.

        The generated parser expects a token stream which can be successfully
        parsed by the combinator [p] and then it expects the end of input.
