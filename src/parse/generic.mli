        Elementary parsing step.

        The function [f] is called with two arguments:
        - The current state
        - The next lookahead token (or none, if the end of the token stream has
        been reached).

        [f] must return either an object of type ['a] and a new state if it
        accepts the token, or a failed expectation if it rejects the token.

    (** {1 Make the Final Parser} *)

    val make: State.t -> Final.t t -> (State.t -> Expect.t) -> Parser.t
    (** [make state p e] Makes a parser.

        - [state] Initial state
        - [p] Combinator which returns in case of success an object of type
        [Final.t]
        - [e] Error function. Generates an expectation from the state. The
        function is used if at the expected end of input other token arrive.

        The generated parser expects a token stream which can be successfully
        parsed by the combinator [p]. It can succeed only if an end token is
        pushed to the parser.

    val make_parser: State.t -> Final.t t -> Parser.t
    (** [make_parser state p].

        Makes a parser which starts in state [state] and parses a construct
        defined by the combinator [p]. The parser can succeed, even if no end
        token is pushed to the parser.
