{0 Fmlib}

The library [Fmlib] supports functional programming with managed effects. It has
the following components:


- {{: ../fmlib_std/index.html}[Fmlib_std]} Standard Types

- {{: ../fmlib_pretty/index.html}[Fmlib_pretty]} Pretty Printing

- {{: ../fmlib_parse/index.html}[Fmlib_parse]}  Parsing

- {{: ../fmlib_js/index.html}[Fmlib_js]} Interface to javascript via [js_of_ocaml]


All libraries of {e Fmlib} are prefixed by [Fmlib_] to avoid nameclashes with
any other used libraries.



{1 Design and Implementation}

The design and the implementation of some modules is described
{{: https://fmlib_ocaml.readthedocs.io} in this document}.



{1 Design Philosophy}

All components of {e Fmlib} work independently of any input/output methods i.e.
they can be used in any environment.

The printers do not actually print. They generate a lazy stream of characters
which can be output on any medium.

The parsers do not actually read from input. They work in push mode. You can
choose your input method and you push the characters into the parser.

The library is {e functional} in the sense that it avoids mutation or uses
mutation only locally to improve performance. Exception handling is avoided as
well. The module {{: ../fmlib_std/Fmlib_std/Result/index.html}
[Fmlib_std.Result]} can be used to achieve the same
effect as exception handling.
